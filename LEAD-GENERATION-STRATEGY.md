## PART 1: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### A. TRUST IS EVERYTHING

**For Black Communities:**
- Historical distrust of financial institutions (Freedman's Bank 1874 collapse still impacts trust today)
- 18% wouldn't recommend their bank (vs 14% non-Black consumers)
- **Solution:** Partner with Black-owned media, community organizations, churches

**For Spanish Communities:**
- $215 billion in taxes paid by Spanish speakers, but lack resources in Spanish
- **Solution:** TRUE Spanish content (not just translation), cultural resonance
- **Messaging:** "Hablamos tu idioma" + community connection

### B. EITC IS YOUR GOLDMINE

**The Opportunity:**
- 25% of eligible workers DON'T claim EITC
- Average refund for low-income families: $2,000-$8,000
- **Hook:** "You may be leaving $8,046 on the table"

**2025 EITC Maximum Credits:**
- No children: $649
- 1 child: $4,328
- 2 children: $7,152
- 3+ children: $8,046

**Other Credits to Emphasize:**
